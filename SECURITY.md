We take the security of PM2 UI seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in our project, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities by sending an email to [thenickygee@proton.me](mailto:thenickygee@proton.me).

### What to Include

If possible, please include the following information in your report:

- A description of the vulnerability

### Response Expectations

After you submit a report, here's what you can expect from us:

- I will try to acknowledge receipt of your report within 3 business days.
- I will try to confirm the vulnerability and communicate my plans for a fix within 10 business days.
- I may contact you for additional information during my investigation.
- Once the vulnerability has been resolved, I will update the security policy accordingly.

### Disclosure Policy

I believe in responsible disclosure and will credit researchers who discover vulnerabilities if they wish. However, I ask that you keep the issue confidential until I have had a chance to address it.

Thank you for helping to keep PM2 UI and its users safe!
